# Project Vision

Our vision is to make Venom Punks the premier NFT project on the Venom Foundation platform, challenging industry leaders and expanding the Venom Ecosystem through innovative products like a dedicated marketplace, Venom Name Service, and the wVenom Wrapper Station, fostering wider adoption and influencing the Venom Foundation Ecosystem.

# Project Description

We are proud to introduce Venom Punks, the pioneering NFT project on the Venom Foundation Blockchain. Our mission is to set new standards of innovation and inspire others in the NFT space. Taking inspiration from the trailblazing success of Crypto Punks, Venom Punks aims to become the leading NFT collection on the Venom Foundation platform.

We are building a robust ecosystem that offers Venom Punks holders a range of long-term utilities. These utilities include a dedicated marketplace, Venom Name Service, wVenom Wrapper Station, DAO, and more. We are doxed and have recently released our whitepaper, which provides detailed information about our project.

With tremendous potential and long-term success, both the project itself and the Venom Foundation blockchain offer exciting opportunities. Being the first-ever NFT project on such a prominent blockchain sets the stage for massive growth and recognition.

We, a team of highly experienced developers and community managers, have been early adopters of the Venom Foundation blockchain since November 2022. Witnessing the growth of the community on Discord and Twitter, we are dedicated to supporting the Venom Foundation ecosystem. With Venom Punks at the forefront, our goal is to drive adoption, establish ourselves as a leading dApp, and contribute to the prominence of the Venom Foundation blockchain.

We have already achieved notable milestones in our journey, such as successfully listing Venom Chain on platforms like subber.xyz and superful.xyz. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with various NFT projects on different blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, SUI, Aptos, and more. Continuously engaging with our community, we provide education and support through our Discord channel, while also conducting tasks and initiatives, such as following Venom Foundation, on Zealy. We just did a test mint for our discord community, and a 10,000 test supply was minted in 20 minutes, producing the biggest transaction on venomscan by an independent project.

Our ultimate vision is to establish Venom Punks as the leading NFT project on the Venom Foundation platform, competing with renowned NFT projects like Crypto Punks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Bitcoin Punks, Azuki, VeeFriends, DeGods, and others. By challenging these projects, Venom Punks aims to bring the entire NFT space onto the Venom Foundation Blockchain, thereby fostering the development of numerous new NFT projects on the platform. Leveraging our expertise in development and community building, we are committed to assisting these projects in their growth and success.

In addition, our goal is to broaden the Venom Ecosystem and its adoption through products (dedicated marketplace, Venom Name Service, wVenom Wrapper Station) that will have a direct impact on the Venom Foundation Ecosystem.
